**Users**
- `user_id` (PK)  
- `full_name`  
- `email` (unique)  
- `password_hash`  
- `date_joined`  

**Courses** *(Digital Products)*  
- `course_id` (PK)  
- `title`  
- `description`  
- `price`  
- `thumbnail_image`  
- `category` *(Basic, Advanced, Electric Bikes, etc.)*  
- `difficulty_level` *(Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)*  
- `duration` *(hours or modules)*  
- `average_rating`  

**Orders**
- `order_id` (PK)  
- `user_id` (FK ‚Üí Users)  
- `order_date`  
- `total_amount`  
- `payment_status` *(Paid / Pending / Failed)*  

**Order Items**
- `order_item_id` (PK)  
- `order_id` (FK ‚Üí Orders)

- `user_id` (FK ‚Üí Users)  
- `course_id` (FK ‚Üí Courses)  
- `purchase_date`  
- `progress` *(optional, percentage completed)*
